# Advent of Code 2021

These are my implementations for [the 2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

To run a puzzle, simply execute the program with the day number as a parameter.
For instance, to run the puzzle for the first day, run:

```shell
❯ cargo run 1
   Compiling advent2021 v0.1.0 (/home/romain/dev/advent/advent2021)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.19s
     Running `target/debug/advent2021 1`
1:1 — Number of increases: 1195
1:2 — Number of increases on a three elements sliding window: 1235
Done in 4ms
